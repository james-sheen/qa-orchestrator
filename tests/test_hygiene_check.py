"""Tests for the pre-commit hygiene check.

**A hygiene check that has never refused anything is not evidence of a clean
tree.** One of the shipped rules was dead on arrival -- the RFC1918 pattern was
missing a separator between its prefix and the remaining octets, so it demanded
four digits where an octet and a dot belonged and never matched an ordinary
private address. It was written, read back, and looked entirely reasonable.
Nothing but planting an address and checking the rule fired could have found it.

So every rule gets two tests: it fires on a plant, and it stays quiet on
something that looks similar and is fine. The second half is the half that keeps
the check usable -- a rule that goes red for a legitimate reason on every run
teaches everyone to skip the whole check, which costs more than the rule is
worth.

`test_every_rule_has_a_plant` is the guard against this file drifting behind the
rule list: add a rule without a plant and it fails, rather than the new rule
quietly never being exercised.
