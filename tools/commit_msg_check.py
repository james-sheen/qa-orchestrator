"""Check a commit message before it becomes permanent.

**A commit message is the one published surface that can never be corrected.** A
file can be fixed in the next commit; a README can be rewritten; a released
package can be superseded. A message is immutable the moment it is pushed, and no
check can ever read it afterwards to tell you it was wrong.

That asymmetry is the whole reason this exists. The hygiene check guards files and
cannot see the message. This guards the message using the same rules, so a token,
an internal ticket id or a private module path cannot reach history through the
one door that has no lock on it.

    git config core.hooksPath .githooks     # once, per clone -- enables this too
    python3 tools/commit_msg_check.py FILE  # check a message by hand

Exit 0 clean, 1 refused, 2 the check could not run.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK: imperative mood. Git's convention is that a
subject completes *this commit will...*, because git composes sentences around it
-- `git revert` on a declarative subject reads as reverting TO the broken state.
The convention is real and worth following. It is not checkable: the clearest
violation this project has produced began with the word `declare`, which any
first-word heuristic reads as a perfect imperative. A rule that cannot separate
the good case from the bad one would refuse honest messages, and a hook that
refuses honest work is a hook people learn to pass `--no-verify` -- which turns
off the leak rules too. So the mood convention is documented and not enforced.
