"""Refuse to commit things that should not be published.

This repository is **authored in public**. There is no private tree, no scrub and
no staging step between what gets written here and what the world reads. That
removes an entire class of bug -- nothing can be mangled in translation -- and it
removes the safety net at the same time. There is nowhere for a check to live
except before the commit, which is where this runs.

    git config core.hooksPath .githooks      # once, per clone
    python3 tools/hygiene_check.py --all     # sweep the whole tree
    python3 tools/hygiene_check.py           # staged content only (the hook)

Exit 0 clean, 1 something was found, 2 the check could not run. The third is
distinct because a hygiene check that cannot run must not read as a pass.

WHAT THIS CANNOT DO. It matches patterns, so it finds the shapes it knows and
nothing else. A pattern list written by asking *what might I leak?* enumerates
what its author already remembers not to do; that is why the last class below
came from asking what this project handles that no other one does, rather than
from a general checklist. Treat a clean run as the absence of known shapes, not
as evidence the diff is safe to publish.

THE EXEMPTION MARKER. A line ending in `hygiene: synthetic` is skipped. It exists
because the redaction tests must contain realistic-looking asset tags in order to
assert that they never reach a capture -- the check and the test want the same
strings for opposite reasons. The cost is real and worth stating: a genuine
secret pasted onto a marked line is invisible here. The marker is per-line, never
per-file, so it stays visible at the site and in review.

    #    numbers, asset tags and MAC addresses, and the natural way to build a

    #    the parsed sensor set for exactly this reason; this catches the paths

    # that shape, and the alternatives were both worse than narrowing the rule:
    # the files are third-party and must stay verbatim, so a per-line marker
    # cannot be added, and a per-directory exemption would create precisely the
    # unwatched corner this checker's own design forbids.
    #
    # The narrowing is deliberately the smallest one that works. A value that is
    # ENTIRELY one `$identifier` is a placeholder; anything else -- including
    # `Unknown` and a real part number -- still fires.

    #    repository by its house number becomes, under any substitution, *in the

    #    they can act on. A visible leak turned into an invisible non-sequitur.
    #    The sentence has to be rewritten for someone who has only THIS
    #    repository, and only its author can do that.
    #
    #    Added after one such nickname reached the commit messages of four
    #    public repositories at once. The rule already existed in a private
    #    scrub and would have caught it; the guard that was actually ASKED about
    #    a commit message had never heard of it. A rule is only as wide as the
    #    surfaces it is run against.
